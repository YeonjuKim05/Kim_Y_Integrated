## Project description
This is the FINAL INTEGRATED PROJECT for IDP-MMED-1050 <br>
The subject of the website is entirely up to the student, and 3 Web pages based on the HTML/CSS.
This project requires taking 10 original photos using the proper layer structure.
Also, allow using additional free stock photos.
	
## Project Process
There are 4 steps(for me):
1. Search for various references.
2. Build up the wireframe and sitemap.
3. Design an entire layout in Photoshop.
4. Make a real website with HTML and CSS!
	
## Memo
I picked the Bakery website as the subject of this project since my friend runs a small bakery shop
so I was thinking if I got a chance to design her bakery website what would it be looked much nicer.
And I built a bunch of CSS effects after I designed all the details.

I took lots of photos for this web from scratch.
I picked up different bakeries, cakes, and cookies from the famous shop around my place. And set the tiny studio for this.
I think it took a long while to get a nice shut considering shutter speed and exposure..something like that.
Finally, I'm done with this crazy step and linked in CSS
