1. Search various reperence.

## Memo
I picked Bakery website as the subject of this project since my friend runs a small bakery shop
so I was thinking if I got a chance to design her bakery website what would it be looked much nicer.
And I built a bunch of css effect after I designed all the details.

I took lots of photos for this web from scrach.
I picked up different bakeries, cakes and cookies from famous shop around my place. And setted the tiny studio for this.
I think it took a long while to get a nice shut considering shutter speed and exposure..something like that.
Finally I'm done with this crazy step and linked in CSS
